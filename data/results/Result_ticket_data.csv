While working on VDI by logging into VPN - due to network connectivity , my VDI hung. I tried many ways to disconnect the VPN , but  it  was not responding. Below is the screen shot of the same :

 

Since VPN was connected at the time time of network failure , I am facing problem on reconnecting my VDI again. Could you please urgently raise a SRQ and request someone to look into it.

User name : adas
VDI details : IBMINKOLVDIV00827

Please let me know , if you have any query.
